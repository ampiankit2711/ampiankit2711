Hi Developers ðŸ‘‹

I'm Full Stack Solution Architect The crossover between design and programming has always been of interest to me, I've been lucky enough to work alongside some talented teams on a number of high profile websites. I have a wide range of skills that include back-end development using open source technologies (NodeJs), design (working closely with designers), front-end development ( ReactJs, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Responsive, UX), Server Administrator(AWS),database(MongoDB,Mysql), CI/CD(Docker, kubernetes)
